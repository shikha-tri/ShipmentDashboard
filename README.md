### API Issues
- In API, there is not a field of brands. So, I have not mentioned the brands column in table
- The timeline api in scans of data, the structure is not in a correct way.

### Issues
- I have not implemented the github repo in my initial time.
- The styling part of the app is not done in a good formatted structure.
- I have not written the test cases for the component.
- May occur some styling issues in mobile version.

### Edge Cases
- Sorted the timeline of an item via using moment and lodash library.
- I have converted the format for the time using moment.
- I have managed the state of timeline, filtering and the current state.
- Managed the current state of logistics in comparison with awbno, So it helps users to get the information.
- I have updated the UI styling for the status of the item in table
